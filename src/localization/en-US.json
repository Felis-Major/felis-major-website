You could never have imagined a place like this, an abandoned town on the verge of decline, that somehow... retains a sense of charm?<br/><br/>Just like their haven, the inhabitants seem to be equally deprived: proles, outcasts, punks and those who fail to be labeled. That's precisely why you moved to this shabby town, neither can you fit in this society... <br/> But, now that you're here, one key point in the ad seems to have been overlooked: Who are the customers of this inn, in a place where tourism does not exist?",
